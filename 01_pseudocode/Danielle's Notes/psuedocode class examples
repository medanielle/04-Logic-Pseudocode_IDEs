1. Explain why each of the following names does or does not seem like a good variable name to represent a state sales tax rate.

stateTaxRate				
txRt					    	too cryptic	
t								too short
stateSalesTaxRateValue			too long
taxRate							not enough info... potentially
1TaxRate						can't start with a # (can start with and _)
moneyCharged					too cryptic, seems off


2. If productCost and productPrice are numeric variables, and productName is a string variable, which of the following statements are valid assignments? 
If a statement is not valid, explain why not.

productCost = 100						Yes, Numeric
productPrice = productCost				yes, product Cost is a numeric
productPrice = productName				no, product name is not numeric
productPrice = “24.95”					no, "" = string in most languages
15.67 = productCost						no,
productCost = productPrice – 10			yes, arithmetic is allowed with numerics
productName = “mouse pad”				yes, this is a string
productCost + 20 = productPrice			no,
productName = 3-inch nails				no, needs quotations
productName = 43						no, needs quotations/ it is numeric
productName = productCost				no, this variable is numeric, not  a string


3. Draw a typical hierarchy chart for a program that produces a monthly bill for a cellphone customer. Try to think of at least 10 separate modules that might be included. 
For example, one module might calculate the charge for daytime phone minutes used.

				produceMonthlyBill()
					getBasic()
					getNumTexts()  getCallMins() 
				
					computeTaxes()
					getFedTax() getStateTax() getLocalTax() getFlatRate()
				
					ComputeFees()
					countryFrom() countryTo()
					
					printBill()

4. Draw the hierarchy chart and then plan the logic for a program that calculates a person’s body mass index (BMI). BMI is a statistical measure that compares a person’s 
body mass index (BMI). BMI is a statistical measure that compares a person’s weight and height. The program uses three modules. The first prompts a user for and accepts 
the user’s hight in inches. The second module accepts the user’s weight in pounds and converts the user’s height to meters and weight to kilograms. Then, it calculates BMI 
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, and displays the results. There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch, 100 centimeters in a meter, 453.59 grams in a pound, 
and 1,000 grams in a kilogram. Use named constants whenever you think they are appropriate. The last module displays the message End of job.

5. Revise the BMI-determining program to execute continuously until the user enters ) for the height in inches.

6. Draw the hierachy chart and design the logic for a program that calculates teh projected cost of a remodeling project. Assume that the labor cost is $30 per hour. Design a 
program that prompts the user for a number hours projected for the job, which is the number of hourstimes the hourly rate plus the 120% of the wholesale cost of materials. The 
program accepts data continuously until 0 is entered for the number of hours. Use appropriate modules, including one that displays End of program when the program is finished.

7. Draw the hierarchy chart and design the logic for a program for Arnie's Appliances. Design a program that prompts the user for a refrigerator model nmae and the interior 
height, width, and depth in inches. Calculate the refrigerator capacity in cubic feet by first multiplying the height, width, and depth to get cubic inches, and then dividing 
by 1728 (the number of cubic inches in cubic foot). The program accepts model names continuoulsly until "XXX" is entered. Use named constants where appropriate. Also use modules, 
including one that displays End of job after the sentinel is entered for the model name.

Practice Exercises
Find The Bugs

1. Your files for this will be provided by the instructor. They include; DEBUG02-01.txt, DEBUG02-02.txt, and DEBUG02-03.txt. Each file starts with some comments that describe the problem. Comments are lines that begin with two slashes (//). Following the comments, each file contains pseudocode that has one or more bugs you must find and correct.

2. Your files for this will be provided by the instructor. They include; DEBUG02-04.jpg that contains a flowchart with syntax and/or logical errors. Examine the flowchart, and then find and correct all of the bugs.

Find the error in the following pseudocode
1. 
Module main()
    Declare Real mileage
    call getMileage()
    Display "You've driven a total of ", mileage, " miles."
End Module

2. 
Module getMileage()
    Display "Enter your vehicle's mileage."
    Input mileage
End Module

Find the potential error in the following pseudocode.
1. 
Module manin()
    Call squareNumber(5)
End Module

2.
Module squareNumber(Integer Ref number)
    Set number = number^2
    Display number
End Module


Summary
Programs contain literals, variables, and named constants
Arithmetic follows rules of precedence
Break down programming problems into modules
Include a header, a body, and a return statement
Hierarchy charts show relationship among modules
As programs become more complicated:
Need for good planning and design increases
