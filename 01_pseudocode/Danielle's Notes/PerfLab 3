Performance Lab 3 options**
Assume that you have created a mechanical robot that can perform the following tasks:

Stand up
Sit down
Turn left 90 degrees
Turn right 90 degrees
Take a step
*Additionally, the robot can determine the answer to one test condition: Am I touching something?

Place two chairs 20 feet apart, directly facing each Other. Draw a structured flowchart or write pseudocode describing the logic that would allow the robot to start from a sitting position in one chair, cross the room, and end up sitting in the other chair. Have a fellow student act as the robot and Carry out your instructions

Draw a structured flowchart or write pseudocode describing the logic that would allow the robot to start from a sitting position in one chair, stand up and circle the chair, cross the room, circle the other chair, return to the first chair, and sit. Have a fellow student act as the robot and carry out your instructions

Assume that you want to look up logic. You might open the dictionary to a random page and see juice. You know this word comes alphabetically before logic, so you flip forward and see lamb. That is still not far enough, so you flip forward and see monkey. You have gone too far, so you flip back, and so on. Draw a structured flowchart or write pseudocode that describes the process of looking up a word in a dictionary. Pick a word at random and have a fellow student attempt to carry out your instructions.

Draw a structured flowchart or write structured pseudocode describing how to decide what college to attend. Include at least two decisions and two loops.

Find the Problem

The intended purpose of the following module is to set the temp parameter to the value 32.0 if it is not already equal to 32.0. This will not work as the programmer expects. Find the problem
Module resetTemperatuze (Real Ref temp)
    If NOT temp == 32.0 Then
       set temp = 32.0 
    End If 
End Module 

The intended purpose of the following module is to determine whether the value parameter is within a specified range. The module will not work. Find the problem

Module checkRange (Integer value, Integer lower, Integer upper)
    If value < lower AND value > upper Then 
       Display "The value is outside the range."
    Else
       Display "The value is with the range."
    End If 
End Module

Assume that you have created a mechanical arm that can hold a pen. The arm can perform the following tasks:
* Lower the pen to a piece Of paper
* Raise the pen from the paper
* Move the pen 1 inch along a straight line. 
  * If the pen is lowered, this action draws a 1-inch line from left to right; 
  * if the pen is raised, this action just repositions the pen 1 inch to the right 
* Turn 90 degrees to the right
* Draw a circle that is 1 inch in diameter


2-inch by 1-inch rectangle

Module main
	start
		TwoInLine()
		OneInLine()
		TwoInLine()
		OneInLine()
	end

module twoInLine()
	start
		lower pen
		move pen 1in
		move pen 1in
		raise pen
		turn 90 degrees
	end
	
module OneInLine()
	start
		lower pen
		move pen 1in
		raise pen
		turn 90 degrees
	end




Draw a structured flowchart or write structured pseudocode describing the logic that would cause the arm to draw or write the following. Have a fellow student act as the mechanical arm and carry out your instructions. Don't reveal the desired outcome to your partner until the exercise is complete.
1-inch square
2-inch by 1-inch rectangle
string Of three beads
short word (for example, cat)
