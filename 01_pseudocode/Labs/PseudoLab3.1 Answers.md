1. Design an If-Then statement (or a flowchart with a single alternative decision structure) that assigns 20 to the variable y and assigns 40 to the 
variable z if the variable x is greater than 100.

if x > 100 then
	y = 20
	z =40
end if

2. Design an If-Then statement (or a flowchart with a single alternative decision structure) that assigns 0 to the variable b and assigns 1 to the 
variable c if the variable a is less than 10.

if a < 10 then	
	b = 0
	c = 1
end if

3. Design an If-Then-Else statement (or a flowchart with a dual alternative decision structure) that assigns 0 to the variable b if the variable a is less than 10. 
Otherwise, it should assign 99 to the variable b.

if a < 10 then
	b = 0
else 
	b = 99
end if

4. The following pseudocode contains several nested If-Then-Else statements. Unfortunately, it was written without proper alignment and indentation. 
Rewrite the code and use the proper conventions of alignment and indentation.
```
If score < 60 Then
Display "Your grade is F."
Else
If score < 70 Then
Display "Your grade is D."
Else
If score < 80 Then
Display "Your grade is C."
Else
If score < 90 Then
Display "Your grade is B."
Else
Display "Your grade is A."
End If
End If
End If
End If
```

If score < 60 Then
	Display "Your grade is F."
Else
	If score < 70 Then
		Display "Your grade is D."
	Else
		If score < 80 Then
			Display "Your grade is C."
		Else
			If score < 90 Then
				Display "Your grade is B."
			Else
				Display "Your grade is A."
			End If
		End If
	End If
End If


5. Design nested decision structures that perform the following: If amount1 is greater than 10 and amount2 is less than 100, display the greater of amount1 and amount2.

if amount1 > 10 AND amount2 <100 then
	if amount1 > amount2 then
		Display amount1
	else 
		Display amount2
	end if
end if
	

6. Rewrite the following If-Then-Else If statement as a Select Case statement.
```
If selection == 1 Then
   Display "You selected A."
Else If selection == 2 Then
   Display "You selected 2."
Else If selection == 3 Then
   Display "You selected 3."
Else If selection == 4 Then
   Display "You selected 4."
Else
   Display "Not good with numbers, eh?"
End If
```

Case based on selection
	Case == 1
		Display "You selected A."
	Case == 2 
		Display "You selected 2."
	Case == 3 Then
		Display "You selected 3."
	Case == 4 Then
		Display "You selected 4."
	Default
		Display "Not good with numbers, eh?"
End Case


7. Design an If-Then-Else statement (or a flowchart with a dual alternative decision structure) that displays “Speed is normal” if the speed variable is 
within the range of 24 to 56. If speed holds a value outside this range, display “Speed is abnormal.”


if speed > 24 AND speed < 56 then
	Display “Speed is normal”
Else
	Display “Speed is abnormal.”
End if


8. Design an If-Then-Else statement (or a flowchart with a dual alternative decision structure) that determines whether the points variable 
is outside the range of 9 to 51. If the variable holds a value outside this range it should display “Invalid points.” Otherwise, it should display “Valid points.”

if points < 9 AND points > 51 then
	Display “Invalid points.”
Else 
	Display “Valid points.”
End if


9. Design a case structure that tests the month variable and does the following:

* If the month variable is set to 1, it displays “January has 31 days.”

* If the month variable is set to 2, it displays “February has 28 days.”

* If the month variable is set to 3, it displays “March has 31 days.”

* If the month variable is set to anything else, it displays “Invalid selection.”


Case based on month
	Case == 1
		Display “January has 31 days.”
	Case == 2 
		Display “February has 28 days.”
	Case == 3 Then
		Display “March has 31 days.”
	Default
		Display “Invalid selection.”
End Case

10. Write an If-Then statement that sets the variable hours to 10 when the flag variable minimum is set.

if flag = 0 then
	hours == 10
end if
